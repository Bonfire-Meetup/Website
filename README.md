# Bonfire Events Homepage

Welcome to the official Bonfire Events homepage. It burns bright, loads fast (mostly), and occasionally refuses to cooperate on mobile. You're in good company.

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- next-intl for i18n
- Bun for scripts/dev

## Local dev

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Contributing

PRs welcome — especially for performance fixes, layout tweaks, and “why is this pixel doing that” mysteries. If you spot a bug, send a PR (or at least a good meme with the issue).
