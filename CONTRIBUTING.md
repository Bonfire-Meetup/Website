# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to the Bonfire Events homepage.

## How to contribute

- **Bugs and ideas:** Open an issue (use the Bug or Feature template).
- **Code:** Open a pull request. Use the PR template and run `bun run check` before submitting.

## Local setup

See the [README](README.md) for install, env vars, and running the app. Use **Bun** as the package manager.

## Code style

We use **oxlint** and **oxfmt**. Run `bun run check` to lint and check formatting, and `bun run fix` to auto-fix. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is for AI agents (Codex, Claude, Gemini, etc.) and has detailed conventions if you want to align with them.

## Security

Do not report security vulnerabilities in public issues. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
